## Continuous Integration
Run tests locally -> Compile the mainline -> Run tests on mainline -> Report on tests

Code, build, release. Continuous delivery and deployment.

So why does it take so damn long in our work??

Running a test or codes locally. Have the code and going to test it on our local device.
