Object Oriented Programming.
classes are great.

Encapsulation.
Modular.
Benefits of OOP
- Re-usability
- Organisation
- Enhanced data security

Easier to test and maintain. Build a well designed class or object that you can use again and again and again.
DRY Principle. Don't repeat yourself.

I'm very cross and moody today. I don't know why particularly, it's my last day I shoudl be thrilled.

What is OOP in Python?

It's an approach fo modelling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, lime companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on.

What is a class?
It's a key term in OOP. It's a blueprint or a template of creating objects. Instances of objects can be made from a class. Define characteristics and behaviours of an object. Then you use the class to make an instance of the object.
Need to understand classes.
So for this example, our class is a Car.
So it has key attributes, colour, make, miles per gallon etc.
Behaviours are things it can do. So a car can brake, accelerate, start, change gear etc. Its an action or a function. Something you do with it.
So we define all the ays a car could be and that's the class. Then we make a specific object, and that's a specific instance of that class. So a specific car, I could use the car class to create Maximus. Bit like having a stored procedure, and hten a task being a particular instance of that stored procedure being called.
Maximus, our instance, will inherit all the behaviour etc from the car class, so he can drive, brake etc without needing to restate that.
Got an example here of class Employee. Defined within are the attributes and then the methods. So a method is showin with brackets.
So diagram is like
|class Employee|
|----------------|
|+Name|
|+NI Number|
|+Salary|
| |
|+PaySalary()|
