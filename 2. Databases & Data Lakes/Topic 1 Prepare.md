# Consolidation Exercise

So I need to:

## Reflect on the dramatic decrease in storage costs over the decades and the strategic implications of this trend for data-driven decision-making within the context of the HR department.
Okay, so what do I think the HR department does?

- Handles payroll
- Recruitment
- Behavioural issues from existing colleagues
- Restructuring, firing people.
- Sorting out benefits, so getting benefits for colleagues and also managing and maintaining them.
- Tracking diversity and responding to that, making sure equal opportunities etc.
- Training
  
  So they will have storage about:
  Colleagues
    - Their identity
    - Their role
    - Their career history
    - Their wage, pension, benefits
    - Their communications in the past
    - Their performance in the past and now

  Organisation
    - Different teams, departments, organisations
    - Work hierarchy, who manages who.
    - How many people in various areas

 Training
   - all the different services, modules etc, bookign systems for booking systems, systems like Pluralsight etc for self led training.
   - Data on who is completing hte training, when, how long it's taking, how much they're doing. Can figure out how popular particular courses are.
   - Monitor mandatory training similarly.

Benefits
  - What benefits are available to colleagues, how much is it costing the bank, or the colleague, how many people are taking it up, is that trending up or down over the years.
  - Maybe data about potential new benefits, courting new companies that might provide new perks etc
  - Perks at work data. What are people mostly using that for? What's worth keeping?
  - Maybe gathering feedback from colleagues on waht they would like to see, so future packages can be put together differently
  - Maintaining old packages, data about what previous pensions looked like etc, so might have multiple benefit packages across the workforce and need to know what benefit packages particular colleagues belong to.

So with lots of data around these things I think that the HR department with loads of cheap data, rather than little can:

- Do more performance management than before, have automated systems that track things and provide a constant flow of data about colleagues and what they are doing.
- Understand changes to the heirarchy over time and overlay with redundancies and hiring information to see trends in departments, are some on the up and some on the down? Can make decisions about where resource needs to go.
- Customise and more directly target colleagues with training that will suit their role, maybe their work style (based on performance management) and really help them upskill.
- GO through colleagues performance goals/own written up testimonials to really get an overview of what the bank is achieving. Doing some clever data stuff to scrape all of that insight out of free text.

Think that's pretty good. So next:

## Consider how this data-centric approach could be replicated or adapted to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency in other sectors
Sectors? So is that...not the bank? I'm going to go with it is the bank as that feels like it helps me the most.
So what other areas do we have?

### Retail, branch, customer service on the phones, mobile messaging etc
Okay so that feels nice and easy, so we can gather data to
- Understand our potential customers, who is engaging with us, where in the journey are htey dropping off before getting a product with us
- Existing customers, what other products will suit them as an individual based on the data we have about them
- The public, who are we missing, can we target particular areas where we don't seem to have much of a market, or maybe identify our successful areas and target them to get even more.
- Understand popularity of particular products etc.
  
### Fraud
- Loads of data about the ways that customers transact so that you can identify when a customer is doing something out of their ordinary and perform extra checks, require extra security and verification.
- Loads of data about the way that fraudsters work, their methods, so that these can be defended against and automatically blocked, as well as new products potentially designed to actually completely eliminate the methods the fraudsters had (think move away from cheque books).
- Gather data about fraudsters to pass along to the police so action can be taken against them.
  
### Finance
- Transaction data, billions of transactions on credit cards, debit cards, loans, mortgages, our insurance products etc.
- Outgoings, how much do all the colleagues cost, the hardware, the buildings, the expenses.
- Summing that all up, seeing trends emerge, are more people defaulting on mortgages and loans, or are more people making overpayments?
- Insight into peoples savings.
  
### Commercial
- Hmm...I think maybe this is a bad sector because it's just kinda going 'well the same again but with a business rather than an individual!' so...yeah, all of the above applies? But it's for a business. Which I'm sure has some unique things but heck if I know what it is!
  
### Marketing
- Data about competitors, what are they offering, how do their products stack up against ours?
- Where are our customers, cookies on the internet, precision tracking of them, does it seem like they might be considering buying a new car? Maybe we can pop up and give them an advert about a loan for their new car.
- What campaigns and marketing drives have worked and what haven't, what demographics has it reached, return data on how many clicks on ads, views on ads, that kind of thing. New product launch, how many people signed up to it through comparethemarket? All that
  
### Complaints
- Identify pain points in customer journeys based on complaints received. Analyse trends to make sure that we can actually put improvements in place to eliminate future complaints.
- Make sure complaints are handled in a timely manner by having the data to know when the complaint was received and how far through its process it is.
  
### Customer operations (so what we get lots of PEGA for, change of address, power of attorney, bereavement etc)
-...I'm actually not sure on this one, but I think the rest will do!
