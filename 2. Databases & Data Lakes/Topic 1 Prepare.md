# Consolidation Exercise

So I need to:

Reflect on the dramatic decrease in storage costs over the decades and the strategic implications of this trend for data-driven decision-making within the context of the HR department.
Okay, so what do I think the HR department does?

- Handles payroll
- Recruitment
- Behavioural issues from existing colleagues
- Restructuring, firing people.
- Sorting out benefits, so getting benefits for colleagues and also managing and maintaining them.
- Tracking diversity and responding to that, making sure equal opportunities etc.
- Training
  
  So they will have storage about:
  Colleagues
    - Their identity
    - Their role
    - Their career history
    - Their wage, pension, benefits
    - Their communications in the past
    - Their performance in the past and now

  Organisation
    - Different teams, departments, organisations
    - Work hierarchy, who manages who.
    - How many people in various areas

 Training
   - all the different services, modules etc, bookign systems for booking systems, systems like Pluralsight etc for self led training.
   - Data on who is completing hte training, when, how long it's taking, how much they're doing. Can figure out how popular particular courses are.
   - Monitor mandatory training similarly.

Benefits
  - What benefits are available to colleagues, how much is it costing the bank, or the colleague, how many people are taking it up, is that trending up or down over the years.
  - Maybe data about potential new benefits, courting new companies that might provide new perks etc
  - Perks at work data. What are people mostly using that for? What's worth keeping?
  - Maybe gathering feedback from colleagues on waht they would like to see, so future packages can be put together differently
  - Maintaining old packages, data about what previous pensions looked like etc, so might have multiple benefit packages across the workforce and need to know what benefit packages particular colleagues belong to.

So with lots of data around these things I think that the HR department with loads of cheap data, rather than little can:

- Do more performance management than before, have automated systems that track things and provide a constant flow of data about colleagues and what they are doing.
- Understand changes to the heirarchy over time and overlay with redundancies and hiring information to see trends in departments, are some on the up and some on the down? Can make decisions about where resource needs to go.
- Customise and more directly target colleagues with training that will suit their role, maybe their work style (based on performance management) and really help them upskill.
- GO through colleagues performance goals/own written up testimonials to really get an overview of what the bank is achieving. Doing some clever data stuff to scrape all of that insight out of free text.
