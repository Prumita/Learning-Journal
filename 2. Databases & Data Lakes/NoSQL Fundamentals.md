### NoSQL (Not Only SQL)
This is awesome for me, I always thought it was literally No SQL. I mean, that's what it sounds like. Why do they name things in such a misleading fashion?
Oh well, so yeah, it's for semi-structured and un-structured data. But frm that eventually you might be generating some structured data you want to do deep analysis on, so there's still a place for SQL!

So we're seeing a json reminder here, wonder if I can put it in a code block...but for nwo let's write it out
```
  {
    "doorsWindows": [
      {
        "ID": "A",
        "style": "roller",
        "height": 3,
        "width": 3,
        "wall": "front",
        "bay": 2,
        "location": [0.3,0],
        "dimensions": false
      },
      {
        "ID": "B",
        "style": "zincPA",
        "height": 0.9,
        "openingSide": "out",
        "hingePost": "right",
        "wall": "intWall_1",
        "bay": 4,
        "location": [4,0],
        "dimensions": false
        }
      ]
    }
```
