#### NoSQL (Not Only SQL)
This is awesome for me, I always thought it was literally No SQL. I mean, that's what it sounds like. Why do they name things in such a misleading fashion?
Oh well, so yeah, it's for semi-structured and un-structured data. But frm that eventually you might be generating some structured data you want to do deep analysis on, so there's still a place for SQL!
