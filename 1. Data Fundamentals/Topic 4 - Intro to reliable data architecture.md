So what would we do if there was a massive increase in data?
If you had AWS it is automated scaling.

Webinar Agenda
Design vs architecture diagrams and flow charts
Monolithic vs microservices and UML component diagrams
Creating architecture diagrams and applying lenses, layers and chunks

An architectural diagram shows you an entire system without showing you the individual components of that.
Think about designing a house. You don't draw the wall brick by brick, you just draw a wall.
Design diagram of each wall, might contain individual components.

ARchitectural diagram contains high level. Design diagram is the parts.

An architecture diagram
- Explains what you're building
- How stakeholders will interact with it
- The constraints of the system
- Is often drawn as layers

A design diagram
- Normally does not have stakeholders, constraints or layers
- Focuses on one part of the system and shows its building blocks

So thinking about the bits I've done in Powerpoint, I've done design diagrams. Well, a rudimentary version.
What Robbie has done, showing a single simple for the server kinda thing, those are more architectural diagrams.

Design focuses on How and Where, might not show the 'what' exactly because we're in nitty gritty, not high level.
Architecture focuses on Where and What but not the details of 'How'
The lecturer thinks these are wrong but I feel like that makes sense to me?
