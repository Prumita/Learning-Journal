Key aspects non negotioable
Webinar.
Portfolip pieces
formatives (strongly recommended due to feedback towards portfolio pieces)
e-Learning, recommend to do it before the sessions.
Tehre's a lot of overlap, repetition and reinforcing of ideas. As we move on it's less theory and more practical, hard to cover in e-Learning.
A lot of the apply tasks. These are cases of 'do you want some more directive, you can do it.' Don't feel like you have to do it all.

MeEtadata is really key to understanding data and driving good data quality. Which of course we never get. 
But I think maybe for GCP they're really striving towards it.

# Measuring Data Quality
## Accuracy
  How well does our data reflect the real world? Are false items likely?

## Integrity
  How well does our data cover the real world? Are missing items likely?

## Consistency
  How well does our data conform to a single standard? Are discrepancies likely?

## Timeliness
  How up-to-date is our data? Are stale items likely?

## Reliability
  Is the data consistently accurate over tiem? Can the data be depended upon to make critical decisions?

# Open Standards

Might have to deal with all types of information from all different places and external sources. So need everyone to have the same level playing field. 

- F indable
- A ccessible
- I nteroperable
- R eusable

Asked how can we make sure differnt things can communicate. Ideas for that
- Metadata and Data cataloging
- Unique identifiers
- search tools and indexing
- standarsiation of naming conventions
- access control and security
- data formats and standards
- apis for data exchange
- semantic interoperability
- data integration tools
- data standards and traiing

## Dublin Core Metadata Initiative

Standardise the world wide web. Someone has to come along and say we need to set a standard by which we all abide to. Certain attributes that describe the information we're looking at to make it easier.
UK data service. Providing a wide range of social and economic population data. Government data option.
Open banking standards. Share information between banks an third parties. Make it easier for banks to understand about indivuals and also for us to understad about ourselves.

Remove the nasty formatting. 

# Data Stewardship

Assign roles for ensuring data accuracy, completeness and reliability. Who owns the data? Who is responsible for the overall project itself? Who is there to ensure that the actual data quality is up to scratch?

## Focus on sustainabiity

Avoid Data Duplication
Lean data management
Rationalising data storage
Data lifecycle management

## Data Quality Management Beyond Data Stewardship

Some tools I've never heard of! Semantic validity models?
RDF Resource Description Framework
SPARQL
OWL (Web Ontology Language)

Consistent use of vocabularies and ontologies ensures adherence to predefined terms and definitions
Enhances interoperability and semantic clarity of data
Enables effective communication and interpretation across different systems and stakeholders

Used to do this at the beginning of MBNA, who knew it'd be in an official thing.

Have a look for opportunities for shadowing in the business. Find someone who is an adjacent team, or more senior within team. Utilise for a bit of expertise.
