# Waterfall

We know what this is! 5 steps are Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment. It's sequential (goes in order) and linear (moves in one direction only). 
Has it's place but is limited.

# Agile

Better! Overall.

Couple of different techniques here, scrum and kanban.

Scrum emphasises close collaboration and breaking things down.
Sprint is usually 1 to 4 weeks.

Kanban board.
Different categorised columns. Different stages of the project overall.
Timelines go from left to right. Backlog usually, then a work in progress, then testing, then final we've finished it section.
Don't want to overstack WIP. Individual tasks and work them through the system.
Need something demonstratable at the end of each sprint. As a stakeholder it provides confidence, direction, a chance to feed back.

Scrum roles
Scrum Master
Facilitator of the scrum. They:
- Faciliatate
- Improve
- Protect
- Reward
- Educate
- Encourage

They are helping planning meetings, define sprint goals, look at the backlog.

Sprint planning:
- Preparation
- Sprint goal definition
- Story selection
- Task estimation
- Planning poker
- Voting
- Consensus building
- Finalisation

Traditional project management way is this idea of planning poker. Not the easiest thing to explain. The project manager finds it quite difficult to explain even!
Task estimation.
People utilise as what they think of. Decide how many story points you'll have in a sprint. Quantifiable based off of ways of working, might differ.
Hypothetical, 20 story points. Capacity of workload. 
HIgh priority, customer really needs it.
Quantify the amount that I'm going to put into this. 
Debate over how long something is going to take. 8 out of 20, would have 12 remaining?
Capcity? Working out how much you can do. You know the next 2 week spring, 2 people working full time. 5 working days each per week, 29 days.
A days worth of work. So 19 days left.

Okay I don't think that was really explained at all?

Sprint master has an idea of everyone's capacity and ways of working etc. Product owner would want to push things forward from the backlog.
Sprint goal would need to be defined. HIgh level goal, what do we want to achieve at the end of the particular sprint.
