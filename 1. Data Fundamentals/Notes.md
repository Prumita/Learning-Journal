# Data Fundamentals
## Intro
During this course we are going to look at waterfall and agile methodologies, as well as lean sigma 6.

There's a lovely pyramid that shows that we are really integral to data work, getting all the data in place and ready for other people to use.

Also there's a nice diagram of actionable insight, and how it is a cycle. So starting a data, we move to infomation, then insight, then decision, then action. 
The idea there is that the action leads to more data, so it's a cycle.

## Types of data 
There are five Vs in the data framework:

**Volume** - How much data do we have

**Variety** - What sort of data do we have

**Velocity** - How quickly do we receive that data

**Veracity** - How accurate is the data, how trustworthy is it

**Value** - How much worth can we derive from the data. 

##Qualiative and Quantitive Data

**Quantitive** data is numerical data that you can aggregate, it's your quantities
**Qualitative** data is non-numerical, it could be categorical, it could be text strings, product names etc.

## Sizes of data
