# Measuring Data Quality
##Accuracy
  How well does our data reflect the real world? Are false items likely?

## Integrity
  How well does our data cover the real world? Are missing items likely?

## Consistency
  How well does our data conform to a single standard? Are discrepancies likely?

## Timeliness
  How up-to-date is our data? Are stale items likely?

## Reliability
  Is the data consistently accurate over tiem? Can the data be depended upon to make critical decisions?
